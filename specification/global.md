# I - Global Specification

## 1 - Origin of the need

The MyCalendApp project addresses the need for online event organization, discovery and management. The calendar orientation of this project will allow it to group on a single page upcoming events, accept, refuse or send invitations. A chat linked to each event will allow the participant to organize himself there, as well as to visualize all the information related to the event.
